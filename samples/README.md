## Datasets
In this study we have two datasets, Rowan Couty and Covington areas. Each dataset consists of 1,400 training samples and 30 validation samples. The test dataset of each location are created using the entire lower half of the study area. 

To use the dataset in this study with the provided notebooks, please download the data from the link: 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Yf-GwVWcnPXmCiQb6D6V_EEf-LGZs2i?usp=drive_link

Then, put the two folder in this samples folder. 

Then you can run the notebook with the samples from the two study areas.
