## Geospatial transfer learning with convolutional neural networks for hydrological streamline delineation

## Datasets
In this study we have two datasets, Rowan Couty and Covington areas. Each dataset consists of 1,400 training samples and 30 validation samples. The test dataset of each location are created using the entire lower half of the study area. 

To use the dataset in this study with the provided notebooks, please download the data from the link:
