Traditionally, flow accumulation techniques have been used to extract streamlines, which delineate streamline primarily based on topological information. Recently, machine learning techniques such as the U-net model have been applied for streamlining delineation. Even though the model shows promising performance in geographic areas that it has been trained on, its performance drops significantly when applied to other areas. In this paper, we apply a transfer learning approach in which we use the pre-trained network architectures that have been trained on a large dataset, ImageNet. Then, we fine-tuned the neural networks using smaller datasets collected from Rowan Creek and Covington areas in the US. When we compared the models pre-trained on ImageNet with an attention U-net model which are fine-tuned on the Rowan Creek area, we found that the DenseNet169 model achieved an F1-score of 85% which is about 4% higher than the attention U-net model. Then, to compare the transferability of the models, the top three models in Rowan Creek area and the attention U-net model were fine-tuned further with the samples from the Covington area. We were able to achieve an F1-score of 71.87% in predicting the steam pixels in the Covington area which is significantly higher than training the model from scratch with the samples collected from the Covington area and slightly higher than the attention U-net model.\n","\n","### Keywords: \n","\n","Transfer Learning, Convolutional neural network, Remote Sensing, Streamline detection\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z_Mg1ZYZdU9J"},"source":["## Table of content\n","\n","1.
