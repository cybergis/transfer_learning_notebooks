    "Streamline network delineation plays a vital role in various scientific disciplines and business applications, such as agriculture suitability, river dynamics, wetland inventory, watershed analysis, surface water survey and management, flood mapping. Traditionally, flow accumulation techniques have been used to extract streamline, which delineates the streamline solely based on topological information. Recently, machine learning techniques have created a new method for streamline detection using the U-net model. However, the model performance significantly drops when used to delineate streamline in a different area than the area it was trained on. In this paper, we examine the usage of transfer learning techniques, transfer the knowledge from the prior area and use the knowledge of the prior area as the starting point of the model training for the target area. We also tested transfer learning methods with different scenarios, change the input data by adding the NAIP dataset, retrain the lower and the higher part of the network, and varying sample sizes. We use the original U-net model in the previous research as the baseline model and compare the model performance with the model trained from scratch. The results demonstrate that even though the transfer learning model leads to better performance and less computation power, it has limitations that need to be considered. "
